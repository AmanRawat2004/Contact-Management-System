# Contact-Management-System
A Contact Management System is a software application designed to store, manage, and retrieve contact information efficiently. This system implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to organize contacts based on names, ensuring quick insertion, search, and deletion operations. Additionally, a hash map is utilized to enable rapid lookup of contacts by phone numbers, while a priority queue (min-heap) helps in managing the smallest name lexicographically. The system allows users to add, view, search, and delete contacts through a user-friendly console interface. In this project, we'll create a basic address book application that allows users to add, view, search for, and delete contacts. This project showcases data structures and algorithms in C++ to build an effective and responsive address book.
